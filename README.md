This project implements a real-time face detection application using the Viola-Jones algorithm. 
Built with Python, OpenCV, and Streamlit.
The app captures video from the user's webcam to detect faces.
This allowing for customizable features such as adjustable detection parameters, selectable rectangle colors, and the option to save images of detected faces. 
The user-friendly interface provides clear instructions for operation, making it accessible for both technical and non-technical users.
